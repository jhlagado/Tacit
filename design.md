# Chunked Cell Memory Model

This document describes a **chunked cell memory model**, designed for use in systems with constrained resources, such as Z80-based microprocessors. The model balances memory efficiency and simplicity.

## Overview

- **28 bytes of payload**: Used for storing data, divided into smaller structures.
- **2 bytes for pointer**: Used to link cells together, creating a logical chain or list.
- **1 byte for length**: Tracks the number of used elements in the payload.
- **1 unused byte**: Reserved for future use or expansion.

This design allows efficient traversal and dynamic data management, minimizing pointer overhead while leveraging structured payloads.

## Key Features

### Structure Layout

- **Payload**: Contains up to **7 elements** of 4 bytes each, providing space for small structures or compact data.
- **Pointer**: A 16-bit value linking to the next chunk in the chain.
- **Length**: A single byte to record the number of used elements (3 bits needed for a maximum of 7).
- **Unused Bytes**: Reserved for future use.

Each cell is aligned to **32 bytes**, ensuring predictable memory layout and simplifying pointer arithmetic.

### Pointer Optimization

- The **11 most significant bits** of the pointer are used to address up to **2048 chunks** within a 64KB memory space, due to the 32-byte alignment.
- Only **3 bits** are required to represent the length (max 7).
- This leaves **18 additional bits** (5 + 5 + 8) that can be used for:
  - **Flags**: Application-specific metadata or control flags.
  - **Type Information**: Encoding data types for the payload.

### Benefits

1. **Efficient Memory Usage**: Reduces pointer overhead by grouping multiple elements in a single chunk.
2. **Simple Alignment**: Keeps all cells aligned to 32 bytes, minimizing fragmentation and ensuring fast pointer calculations.
3. **Embedded Metadata**: Leverages pointer bits to store additional information, avoiding separate metadata structures.
4. **Scalability**: Supports up to 2048 chunks within a 64KB memory space.

## Example Layout

### Chunk Structure

```
[Payload (28 bytes)] [Pointer (2 bytes)] [Length (1 byte)] [Unused (1 byte)]
```

### Pointer Encoding

- Example: `11010 000 00000001001`
  - **Type**: `11` (Custom type).
  - **Flags**: Reserved bits for application-specific metadata.
  - **Index**: Points to the 10th chunk (aligned at `10 * 32 = 320` bytes).

## Supported Operations

### Traversal

1. Start at the head chunk.
2. Follow the **pointer index** to the next chunk.
3. Use the **length** field to determine valid elements in each payload.

### Insertion

1. Check the **length field** for available space.
2. If space is available, insert the element and increment the length.
3. If the chunk is full, allocate a new chunk, link it via the pointer, and insert the element.

### Deletion

1. Locate the element to delete.
2. Shift subsequent elements left within the payload.
3. Decrement the length field.
4. If the chunk becomes empty, update the previous chunkâ€™s pointer.

### Concatenation

1. Update the **pointer field** of the last chunk in the first list to point to the head of the second list.

## Trade-offs

### Pros

- Significantly reduces pointer overhead compared to traditional linked lists.
- Improves locality of reference for sequential access.
- Supports dynamic payload sizes with minimal wasted space.

### Cons

- Leaves 1 byte unallocated per 32-byte payload.
- Limited flexibility for payload sizes larger than 28 bytes without structural changes.

## Use Cases

This memory model is ideal for:

- Systems with constrained resources, such as microcontrollers.
- Applications requiring efficient list or buffer management with dynamic elements.
- Scenarios where type-specific operations are common, leveraging embedded type metadata.
